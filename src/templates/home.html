        Welcome to our comprehensive database for the TCNJ energy supply!
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
        Here you are able to browse the data that was provided to us by Mr. Paul Romano (TCNJ's Director of Maintenance) concerning TCNJ's energy supply. The purpose of allowing you to view this data is to help answer two very important questions. These questions are: When is it economical for the campus to produce its own power as opposed to using that of the electric grid?, and when is it least polluting for the campus to produce its own power as opposed to using that of the electric grid, on both a site and source basis? The information provided can help to point out where the major costs are coming from when it comes to powering our campus, and how it can be used to serve the environment as a way of seeing where the energy usage can be cut in the buildings. The database provides detailed breakdowns for each question based on season or even as detailed as 15 minute intervals for a specified date. Our goal is that our users will be able to make the most of the data and functionality provided by this website, and that TCNJ can do its part to help the Earth. Happy searching!
